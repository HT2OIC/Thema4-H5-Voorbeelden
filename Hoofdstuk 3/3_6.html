        Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you
        very much. They were the last people you’d expect to be involved in anything <a href="">strange </a><a href="">or 
        mysterious</a>, because they just didn’t hold with such nonsense.
